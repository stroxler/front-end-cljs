## Video 1

The first commit on this repo is from the end of a mildly-css-styled
variant of [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkcCfDG8ytE) from
the CodeCademy, which covers very basic html:
 * document and body, paragraphs, headers
 * links `<a>` images `<img>` unordered and ordered lists `<ul>` and `<ol>`
 * id tags and internal links

I skipped a few minor notes like using `<&lt;>` to get a literal `<` in
html. I also skipped comments, since that's irrelevant when using hiccup +
reagent.
